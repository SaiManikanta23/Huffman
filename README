This program was written in java
File Description:
It has total of 10 files inside com.sample.huffman package i.e 
Decode.java, decodeFile.java, Encode.java, encodeFile.java, fileReader.java, FrequencyMeasure.java, huffmanImp.java, huffmanTple.java, 
Node.java, WriteFileWorker.java
It has an input file sample1.txt at Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta/src/sample1.txt where I have given input as my name
i.e “SaiManikanta”
I’ve provided sample output files for our given input i.e hpc file and output text file
We have hpc file at the same level i.e at Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta/src/Sample1_Huffman.hpc.
We have final output text file at same level i.e. at Assignment03_Part02_Joseph_Deepika/src/Sample1_final_Recheck.txt.
If we are running in eclipse, directly run the Encode.java file directly as java application. 
But make sure the input file is at project level.
Note:
1.	If we want to change the output file name or location to output the hpc or final file, 
we can do that my changing the location in Encode.java and Decode.java files, Please check the comments where I’ve mentioned,
where we can change the path
2.	If we want to give an different input file, 
either we can directly paste the input file at src level as mentioned above or we can change the location of the input file 
as mentioned in the above point or we can directly change the text in our input file i.e. Sample1.txt
Steps for Execution:
1.	Go to directory where the files are residing
Ex: cd directory_name and then go to project directory cd Huffman
2.	Now go into the package to compile all java files, use the following command by command prompt for going into the package directory
and for compiling all java files.
Ex: let’s say now we are in Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta folder then
Now using command prompt type the following command.
D:\Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta>  cd src/com/sample/huffman
With the above command we go into package where all java files are present, now we compile them as follows:
D:\ Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta\src\com\sample\huffman> javac *.java
This compiles all java files.
3.	Now for executing the program go back to main project directory i.e at source level of project as we have our input file there, 
and also because one file is related to another.
Ex: use cd .. to go back
Once we are at src level, now execute the program as follows
D:\src> java com.sample.huffman.Encode
This executes the program.


4.	The output files are located at directory of src i.e. Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta\src\Sample1_final_Recheck.txt
and Assignment03_Part02_SaiManikanta\src\Sample1_Huffman.hpc
